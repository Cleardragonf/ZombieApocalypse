Things this mod need to be looked into
    •  look at maybe a command api to CLEAR them? or spawn them???
    •  Maybe...make Nerdpoling and Brdiging...temporary? like add them to a list or something....and then clear the list every day? or every other day???? maybe make that configurable?
    •  Include some more features into Safe Spawn...including Light Level...

Fatures that may be nice:
    •  ANGRY Passive entities...if you hit them...aka like a cow...they may suddenly want to kill you?
    •  Maybe tameable mobs? like if you tame a skeleton it'll attack other mobs???
    •  Ability to capture entites in an egg that's thrown?
