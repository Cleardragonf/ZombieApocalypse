Things this mod need to be looked into
    •  look at maybe a command api to CLEAR them? or spawn them???
    •  Include some more features into Safe Spawn...including Light Level...
    •  Look into Commands like home, Back, maybe even...gimme?, spawn, clear etc make sure they're payable...

Fatures that may be nice:
    •  ANGRY Passive entities...if you hit them...aka like a cow...they may suddenly want to kill you?
    •  Maybe tameable mobs? like if you tame a skeleton it'll attack other mobs???
    •  Ability to capture entites in an egg that's thrown?
