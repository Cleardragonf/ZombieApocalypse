Fatures that may be nice:
    •  ANGRY Passive entities...if you hit them...aka like a cow...they may suddenly want to kill you?
    •  Maybe tameable mobs? like if you tame a skeleton it'll attack other mobs???
    •  Ability to capture entites in an egg that's thrown?
    •  Look into better spawned mobs AIs in Spawn
