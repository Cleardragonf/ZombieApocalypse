Fatures that may be nice:
    •  ANGRY Passive entities...if you hit them...aka like a cow...they may suddenly want to kill you?
    •  Maybe tameable mobs? like if you tame a skeleton it'll attack other mobs???
    •  Ability to capture entites in an egg that's thrown?
    •  Look into better spawned mobs AIs in Spawn
    •  Need for the mobs to get more Difficult As the days progress....right now theyre staying just about the same.
    •  Need to make the list of entities and blocks saveable....to a file....so that they're remobable even after a server restart.
    •  Start Adding Halloween things?
    •  Rework Rewards to become Capability.REWARDS....this way entities can give certain Rewards and be saved that way.
